# Speech Synthesis (Text-to-Speech) from AWS Polly

**aws.polly** is a package for [Polly](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/polly), an Amazon Web Services speech synthesis (computer voice) web service.

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and to enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. The [**aws.iam** package](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.iam) profiles tools for working with IAM, including creating roles, users, groups, and credentials programmatically; it is not needed to *use* IAM credentials.

A detailed description of how credentials can be specified is provided at: https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.signature/. The easiest way is to simply set environment variables on the command line prior to starting R or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file, which are used to set environment variables in R during startup (see `? Startup`). They can be also set within R:

```R
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1",
           "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" = "mytoken")
```


## Code Examples

The basic use of the package is super simple and revolves around the `synthesize()` function, which takes a character string and a voice as input:

```{r}
library("aws.polly")

# list available voices
list_voices()

# synthesize some text
vec <- synthesize("Hello world!", voice = "Joanna")
```

The result is a "Wave" object (from the tuneR package), which can be played using `play()`:

```R
library("tuneR")
play(vec)
```

This might also be handy for setting up an audio error handler:

```R
audio_error <- function() tuneR::play(aws.polly::synthesize(geterrmessage(), voice = "Joanna"))
options(error = audio_error)
stop("Everything went horribly wrong")
options(error = NULL)
```
